# Web-Scraping-Tool
This project features a web application built using Flask. It allows users to scrape data from websites by specifying a URL, HTML tag, and class name. The backend (app.py) handles the scraping using BeautifulSoup, while the frontend includes a simple, responsive interface (index.html) with a focus on usability, styled through CSS (style.css). â€‹
